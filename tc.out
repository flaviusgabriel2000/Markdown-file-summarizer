   + Markdown: Syntax
   :<Note> This document is itself written using Markdown [@see the source for it by adding '.text' to the URL]
   ////////////
      + Overview
         + Philosophy
         :Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible:
         :Readability, however, is emphasized above all else [@Setext] [@atx] [@Textile] [@reStructuredText] [@Grutatext] [@EtText]:
      + Block Elements
         + Paragraphs and Line Breaks
         :A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines:
         :The implication of the "one or more consecutive lines of text" rule is that Markdown supports "hard-wrapped" text paragraphs:
         :When you <do> want to insert a `<br />` break tag using Markdown, you end a line with two or more spaces, then type return:
         + Headers
         :Markdown supports two styles of headers,:
         :Optionally, you may "close" atx-style headers:
         + Blockquotes
         :Markdown uses email-style `>` characters for blockquoting:
            "This is a blockquote with"
         :Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the `>` before the first line of a hard-wrapped paragraph:
            "This is a blockquote with"
            "Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam"
         :Blockquotes can be nested (i:
            "This is the first level"
         :Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and code blocks:
            "## This is a header"
         :Any decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy:
         + Lists
         :Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists:
         :Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens:
            [Red; Green; Blue]
         :is equivalent to:
            [Red; Green; Blue]
         :and:
            [Red; Green; Blue]
         :Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:
            [Bird; McHale; Parish]
         :It's important to note that the actual numbers you use to mark the list have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces:
         :If you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this:
            [Bird; McHale; Parish]
         :or even:
            [Bird; McHale; Parish]
         :you'd get the exact same HTML output:
         :To make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents:
            [Lorem ipsum dolor; Donec sit amet]
         :But if you want to be lazy, you don't have to:
            [Lorem ipsum dolor; Donec sit amet]
         :List items may consist of multiple paragraphs:
            [This is a; Suspendisse id sem]
         :It looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent paragraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow you to be :
            [This is a; Another item in]
         :To put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote's `>` delimiters need to be indented:
            [A list item "This is a blockquote inside"]
         :To put a code block within a list item, the code block needs to be indented <*twice*>:
            [A list item "code"]
         + Code Blocks
         :Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code:
         :To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab:
         :This is a normal paragraph:
         [code]
         :Here is an example of AppleScript:
         [code]
         :A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented (or the end of the article):
         :Within a code block, ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`<` and `>`) are automatically converted into HTML entities:
         [code]
         :Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks:
      + Span Elements
         + Links
         :Markdown supports two style of links <inline> <reference>:
         :In both styles, the link text is delimited by:
         :To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text's closing square bracket <optional>:
         :This is [@an example]:
         :[@This link] has no title attribute:
         + Emphasis
         :Markdown treats asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`) as indicators of emphasis:
         <single asterisks>
         <single underscores>
         <double asterisks>
         <double underscores>
         + Code
         :To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes:
         :Use the `printf()` function:
